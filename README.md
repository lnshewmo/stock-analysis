# Excel VBA Green Stocks Analysis

## Project Overview
  
For this project we were tasked with writing a VBA script which looks at the trading volume and annual return of 12 different green energy stocks in 2017 and 2018.  The data supplied for the analysis is contained in an Excel Workbook.  The client, a financial advisor, is initially interested in the performance of Daqo (DY) based on his client's preferences, but to better inform his investment strategy he would like to compare its performance against these other 11 green companies.  His goal is to help guide the investors toward selecting a green stock with a history of high return.  An initial analysis was completed which provided the metrics for the green stocks investment strategy.  However he would now like the script to have capability to evaluate more stocks over a larger time period.  To accomplish this, the code was refactored for efficiency.
